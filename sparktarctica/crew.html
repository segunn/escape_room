	<h1>Captain's Log</h1>
	<h2>Day 196</h2>
	<br>
	<p class='has-dropcap'>It's a big responsibility being the captain of a ship with such a large crew. I've got to make sure I know where everyone is: quartermasters, lieutenants, navigators, engineers, deck cadets, carpenters, first mates, admirals, oilers, cabin boys, watchmen, gunners, bosuns... It's nearly all-consuming, it's a wonder there's <b>space leftover</b> for anything else!</p>
