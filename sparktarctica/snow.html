	<h1>Captain's Log</h1>
	<h2>Day 45</h2>
	<br>
	<p class='has-dropcap'>We've been travelling around the pole for weeks now and I am <i>so</i> sick of snow. They say that every snowflake is unique, but they all look the same to me. I picked up a handful of snow to look at more closely, but I doubt any of them are unique. It's getting hard to think of anything original to write in this log when there's just snow everywhere - I wonder <b>what3words</b> I could come up with?</p>
